 ABC School, 25th February:    A covid vaccination camp was organised by our school for the students of 16-18 aged, on 24th February, 2023. The motive of this camp was to achieve complete vaccination of the students. The camp was started at 11 am and run upto 2pm. A team of doctors and nurses came from Silliguri Medical College and Hospital. There was a huge enthusiasm among the students although some were afraid of injection. Teachers advised the students to make a line maintaining 2 meters gap. They were advised to wear the mask. All of them carried aadhar card and registered their name. Then, they went to the doctors and were given covid vaccine one by one. After that, they were advised to take some rest. In this camp total 1000 students got vaccinated.  All the teachers and health officials played important role to make it successful. At last, our headteacher thanked all the students, doctors and health officials and the camp came to close.
